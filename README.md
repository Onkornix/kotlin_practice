# Kotlin Practice
I'm learning Kotlin for my high school robotics team's software subteam.
These projects are being developed in IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition

### What's in here?
- Guessing game: A program where the computer guesses the number you have in your head
- KAlphabetizer: a Kotlin alphabetizer program. WIP
